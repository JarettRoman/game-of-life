Game of Life
============
Developing a Game of Life based off John Conway Hortin's work (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Using the Kobold2D framework derived from Cocos2D to develop the game for iphones.

I'm making this game by using Make Games With Us' guide located <a href="https://www.makegameswith.us/tutorials/game-of-life/take-the-dive/">here</a>
